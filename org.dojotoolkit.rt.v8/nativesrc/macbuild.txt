Build v8javabridge

Create an X-Code project and add a new BSD Dynamic Library Target called v8javabridge

To this target add a JavaVM.framework Linked Libary and a libv8.a Linked Library (libv8.a is what is produced by the V8 build)


On the Build Tab for the taret add the following paths as Header Search Paths
/Users/rbackhouse/dev/zazl/v8build/v8/src 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers 

Change the "Executable Extension" to be jnilib

Modify v8javabridge.cpp and change "#define V8_TARGET_ARCH_IA32 1" to "#define V8_TARGET_ARCH_X64 1"

Run the build and the output should be libv8javabridge.jnilib
